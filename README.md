## Description/Motivation: 

Itâ€™s an amazing journey so far! This application provides a great overview of 3 tier end to end architecture for a new developer. It includes secutiry aspects such as authentication and authorization. The data flows from client to web server to mongodb and vise versa. It provides a glimpse of how to create secured websites which stores users and their account information. Great exposure on how React components captures user events and gets the required data from database through server api calls.

## Installation Guidelines: 

 * Clone the 3tier_bestbank repo from github.
 * Follow package.json or import sections of code to install dependencies for both front end and back end code.
 * Create a cluster in mongodb and add connection path as DB to your .env file .
 * Add a JWTSECRET or some key which basically contains a string and add it to .env file so we can use it in backend - routes - auth.js file to create a token.
 * Start front and back end servers in 2 terminals using npm start. 
 * First run seed.js from backend terminal, so some user data will be added to cluster(database) collection (table). 
 * Create a new account or login and then explore remaining features.
